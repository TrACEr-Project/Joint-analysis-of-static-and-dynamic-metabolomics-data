# Matlab code
This repository contains the codes used in the paper 'Revealing static and dynamic biomarkers from postprandial metabolomics data through coupled matrix and tensor factorizations'.

All the implementations are tested on MacOS version 10.15.3.

## Toolboxes needed 
*  Brett W. Bader, Tamara G. Kolda and others. MATLAB Tensor Toolbox, Version 3.1. Available on https://www.tensortoolbox.org, 2020
*  Evrim Acar et al, “Structure-revealing data fusion”, BMC Bioinformatics, 15:239, 2014. CMTF Toolbox Available on https://github.com/eacarat/CMTF_Toolbox
*  Daniel M. Dunlavy, Tamara G. Kolda, and Evrim Acar, “Poblano v1.0: A Matlab Toolbox for Gradient-Based Optimization”, 2010. Available online at https://github.com/sandialabs/poblano_toolbox
* Eigenvector Research, DataSet Object, available online at https://eigenvector.com/software/dataset-object/

Toolboxes should be added to the Matlab path.

## File Descriptions  

*  The file 'static_dynamic_acmtf.m' is for fitting an ACMTF model to the fasting and T0-corrected dynamic metabolomics data using multiple initializations, and also plotting the factors
*  The file 'static_dynamic_acmtf_replicability.m' is an example code for checking the replicability of an ACMTF model
     
  ### Descriptions of the files under the folder 'functions'
  * The file 'show_spread.m' and 'bar_wrange.m' are used to plot the weights of the components revealed by an ACMTF model for the runs with the smallest function value
   * The file 'check_spread_only.m' exports the factors of an ACMTF model from specific runs which give the smallest function values
   * The file 'plot_metab_set.m' is used to generate indexes and plotting markers for metabolite classess according to their density and size
   * The file 'preprocess.m' is used to preprocess a third-order tensor or a matrix by centering across the first mode, and scaling within the third mode (second mode if the input is a matrix)
